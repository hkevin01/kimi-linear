# Copilot Instructions for Kimi Linear Project

## Project Context
This is an implementation of the Kimi Linear architecture - a hybrid linear attention mechanism for efficient LLMs.

## Code Style
- Python: PEP 8, Black formatter, 88 char line length
- C++/CUDA: Google C++ Style, 100 char line length
- Always add comprehensive docstrings
- Include type hints for all functions

## Testing Requirements
- Write unit tests for all new functions
- Maintain >95% code coverage
- Include boundary condition tests
- Add synthetic task tests for attention mechanisms

## Performance Considerations
- Prioritize memory efficiency
- Consider GPU memory bandwidth
- Profile before and after optimizations
- Document performance implications

## Documentation
- Add docstrings to all public APIs
- Include usage examples
- Document time/space complexity
- Link to research paper sections
